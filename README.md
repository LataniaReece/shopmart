                  showcases my knowledge of the fullstack side of web
                  development.

# What I Learned 
For this project I wanted to explore ecommerce, mostly out of curiousity but I also wanted to gain these skills for possible projects in the future. While my other MERN project (https://github.com/LataniaReece/techyblogs_2021) had already helped with my understanding of MERN, this project was more to understand ecommerce and how to incorporate the essential ecommerce functionalities like cart tracking, order processing/details and stripejs payments into a MERN application. 

This was also my first introduction to material ui since I was used to Bootstrap. While I like bootstrap overall, I appreciated the built-in table styling in Material Ui for the admin pages.
